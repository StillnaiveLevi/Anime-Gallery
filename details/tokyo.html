        <p> 
       Ken Kaneki is the tragic and complex protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul, whose life changes forever after he becomes a half-ghoul against his will. Originally a gentle, book-loving college student, Kaneki struggles with the horrifying reality of needing human flesh to survive. This inner conflict between his human heart and ghoul instincts forms the emotional core of his journey. Over time, the endless suffering he endures shapes him into a stronger but deeply conflicted individual, symbolized by the iconic shift from his timid, black-haired self to his colder, white-haired persona. Kaneki constantly grapples with questions of identity, morality, and survival as he fights to protect the people he cares about while navigating the violent, oppressive world of ghouls and humans. His evolution from a frightened victim to a powerful, tragic anti-hero makes him one of the most memorable characters in dark fantasy anime.</p>

        <img src="../public/images/tokyoGhouls/rize.jpg" alt="rize's image">
        <p> 
       Rize Kamishiro, known as the “Binge Eater,” is a beautiful yet terrifying ghoul whose encounter with Kaneki sets the entire story in motion. Before her accident, Rize was infamous for her insatiable appetite and her manipulative charm, luring victims with her gentle appearance. When her organs are transplanted into Kaneki, she becomes a haunting presence in his life, both literally and psychologically. Rize symbolizes uncontrollable hunger and the monstrous side of ghoul nature, appearing in Kaneki’s hallucinations as a voice that tempts, mocks, and pushes him toward embracing his darker instincts. Despite her destructive tendencies, Rize is a deeply important figure in the series’ mythology, representing the catalyst of Kaneki’s transformation and the larger secrets surrounding ghoul experimentation.</p>

        <img src="../public/images/tokyoGhouls/juuzou.jpg" alt="juuzou's image">
        <p> 
       Juuzou Suzuya is one of the most striking and unpredictable characters in Tokyo Ghoul, known for his childlike demeanor, eerie calmness, and lethal combat skills. Raised under brutal conditions that shaped him into a detached and emotionally stunted individual, Juuzou initially appears as an almost playful but terrifying investigator who treats battles like games. Despite his traumatic upbringing, he grows significantly through his relationships with mentors like Shinohara, who guide him toward finding humanity and stability. Juuzou’s agility, creativity in combat, and fearlessness make him a formidable opponent on the battlefield, while his gradual emotional development adds depth to his character. He is both unsettling and sympathetic, embodying the blurred line between innocence and violence that defines the world of Tokyo Ghoul.</p>
