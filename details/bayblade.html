        <p> Valt Aoi is the energetic and passionate main protagonist of Beyblade Burst, known for his boundless enthusiasm and unwavering belief in hard work. He starts as an inexperienced blader who simply loves the thrill of battling, but his determination and optimism quickly set him apart. Valt constantly pushes himself to improve, learning from every defeat without losing his positive spirit. His bond with his Bey, Victory Valtryek (and later versions of Valkyrie), reflects his fiery, never-give-up attitude. As he grows, Valt becomes a world-class blader, inspiring his friends and rivals through his sportsmanship and courage. His journey from a cheerful beginner to a respected champion captures the heart of the series, showing how passion, resilience, and kindness can shape a true blader.</p>

        <img src="../public/images/bayblade/free.jpg" alt="free's image">
        <p> 
        Free De La Hoya is one of the strongest and most laid-back bladers in Beyblade Burst, known for his effortless confidence and unmatched stamina. With his Bey, Fafnir, Free relies on a unique spin-stealing ability that allows him to remain calm during battles, often waiting for opponents to wear themselves out. His relaxed attitude can make him seem detached, but beneath it lies a razor-sharp competitive instinct and a deep understanding of Beyblade mechanics. Free rarely shows emotions, yet he respects strong opponents and enjoys the challenge they bring. As one of the “Big Five,” he carries a reputation for being nearly unbeatable, combining natural talent with a cool, almost mysterious presence. Free’s character illustrates the power of mastery, patience, and quiet confidence.</p>

Throughout the series, Shu upgrades Spriggan many times, each version becoming stronger and more dangerous in battle.Shu is both a rival and friend to Valt. His dedication pushes him to extreme levels, even turning dark at one point. Despite this, he always finds his way back and becomes one of the strongest bladers in the world.</p>
