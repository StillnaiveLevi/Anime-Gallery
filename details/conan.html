        Professor Hiroshi Agasa is the quirky, kind-hearted inventor who becomes Conan’s closest adult ally after Shinichi’s transformation. Known for his eccentric humor, generous spirit, and supportive nature, Agasa acts as both guardian and confidant. Despite his often silly inventions, he creates some of the most essential tools Conan uses in investigations, including the voice-changing bowtie, the turbo-powered skateboard, and the tranquilizer watch. Agasa also plays a crucial emotional role, offering Conan guidance and covering up his identity when necessary. Additionally, he looks after the Detective Boys, helping them in everyday life and occasionally joining in their smaller cases. While Agasa isn’t a detective himself, his intelligence, warmth, and unwavering loyalty make him an indispensable part of Conan’s journey.</p>

        Shuichi Akai is one of the most formidable and mysterious characters in Detective Conan, known for his icy demeanor, sharp instincts, and elite marksmanship. As an FBI agent, he has dedicated his life to infiltrating and taking down the Black Organization, even at the cost of his own safety. Akai’s cold, stoic personality hides a deep sense of justice and emotional complexity, shaped by painful losses and the dangerous missions he undertakes. His rivalry with Gin, one of the organization’s top operatives, adds high stakes to the story and showcases his strategic brilliance. Shuichi often operates in the shadows, coordinating with Conan and trusting his abilities more than most adults do. His presence brings intensity and depth to the series, symbolizing perseverance, sacrifice, and the pursuit of truth against overwhelming darkness.</p>
