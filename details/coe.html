        <p> 
       Kiyotaka Ayanokoji is the enigmatic and calculating protagonist of Classroom of the Elite, known for his emotionless demeanor and unmatched intelligence. Although he intentionally keeps a low profile in Class D, his actions reveal a mind trained for perfection. Raised in the White Room, Ayanokoji developed extraordinary analytical skills, strategic thinking, and physical abilities, but also learned to suppress emotions and avoid forming attachments. Despite appearing uninterested and passive, he subtly manipulates events from the shadows, guiding his classmates toward success while ensuring his true capabilities remain hidden. His character reflects themes of psychological control, emotional restraint, and the struggle between personal freedom and the expectations forced upon him.</p>

        <img src="../public/images/coe/suzune.jpg" alt="Suzune's image">
        <p> 
        Suzune Horikita is a determined and academically gifted student of Class D who strives to rise to Class A through sheer effort. Serious and often blunt, she isolates herself from others, believing that success is earned individually rather than through teamwork. Her cold attitude initially causes conflicts, but her interactions with Ayanokoji gradually push her to develop emotional awareness and recognize the value of collaboration. Much of Suzune’s motivation comes from her desire to prove herself to her older brother, Manabu, whose approval she deeply seeks. Over time, she becomes more open, empathetic, and capable as a leader, representing growth, self-reflection, and the challenge of overcoming personal flaws.</p>

        <img src="../public/images/coe/manabu.jpg" alt="Manabu's image">
        <p> 
        Manabu Horikita, the former student council president, represents discipline, intelligence, and unwavering dedication. He carries himself with an air of authority and precision, earning respect across the school. Manabu’s leadership style is strict but fair—he demands excellence and expects students to take responsibility for their failures and achievements. His composed personality often makes him seem distant, yet he genuinely wants to uphold the school’s ideals and push others, especially his younger sister Suzune, to grow beyond their limits. Manabu serves as a symbol of order and ambition within the highly competitive environment of the Advanced Nurturing High School.</p>
