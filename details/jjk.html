        <img src="../public/images/jjk/gojo.jpg" alt="gojo's image">
        <p> 
      Satoru Gojo is widely regarded as the most powerful jujutsu sorcerer in Jujutsu Kaisen, known for his overwhelming strength, speed, and mastery of Limitless techniques. Beyond his immense combat abilities, Gojo has a playful and often irreverent personality, teasing both allies and enemies while carrying a deep sense of responsibility for the next generation of sorcerers. He is fiercely protective of his students, especially Itadori, and works to reform the jujutsu world’s rigid hierarchy. Gojo’s confidence is matched by his intellect, making him a tactician as well as a powerhouse. While he often appears carefree and cocky, his presence carries significant weight, inspiring hope among allies and fear in curses and enemies alike.</p>

        <img src="../public/images/jjk/itadori.jpg" alt="Itadori's image">
        <p> 
       Yuji Itadori is the kind-hearted, determined protagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen, known for his extraordinary physical abilities and unwavering sense of justice. Initially an ordinary high school student, his life changes after ingesting one of Sukuna’s fingers, becoming a host to the King of Curses. Despite the dangers he faces, Yuji maintains his empathy and optimism, determined to protect others from harm while honoring his grandfather’s belief in a meaningful life. His growth as a sorcerer is shaped not just by battles but by the moral choices he must make when confronting curses and human corruption. Yuji embodies courage, compassion, and the struggle to reconcile immense power with a pure heart.</p>

        <img src="../public/images/jjk/sukuna.jpg" alt="sukunna's image">
        <p> 
        Sukuna, also known as the King of Curses, is an ancient and malevolent curse who resides within Itadori after he consumes his fingers. Ruthless, cunning, and supremely confident, Sukuna delights in chaos and has no regard for human life. His immense cursed energy and combat skills make him one of the deadliest beings in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe. Despite being bound to Yuji, Sukuna often manipulates situations for his own amusement, testing Yuji and other sorcerers alike. He represents raw power, fear, and the embodiment of humanity’s darkest instincts, serving as both a threat and a mysterious force driving much of the series’ tension.</p>

    <div>
        <img src="../public/images/jjk/nanami.jpg" alt="nanami's image">
        <p> 
        Kento Nanami is a professional jujutsu sorcerer characterized by his pragmatic, disciplined nature and strong sense of duty. Unlike many sorcerers, he treats his work seriously, adhering to a strict 9-to-5 approach while maintaining exceptional combat skill. Nanami is calm, analytical, and reliable, often acting as a mentor and moral compass for Itadori. Beneath his composed exterior lies a compassionate side, showing care for his students and allies while confronting curses with precision and efficiency. Nanami’s balance of rationality, strength, and quiet heroism makes him a grounding presence in the chaotic world of jujutsu sorcery.</p>
